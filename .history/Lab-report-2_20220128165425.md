Here's the Markdown file after I fixed the bug:
![Image](last.png)

I added lines 16-18, 13, 24, and 34, which fixed the bug.  The bug was that if there was text after the last parenthesis, the currentIndex would stay one more than the closeParen and never exceed the length of the file.  This meant that the while loop would run foreve, which created the Java.lang.OutofMemoryError.  The first fix I did involved lines 13. 16-18, and 24.  These lines stoped the for loop if the currentIndex was still bigger than the nextOpenBracket after the line updating the nextOpenBracked value runs. This stops the whileloop if there is text after the last parenthesis so the while loop doens't go in an infiintie loop.  The next fix I did was in line 34 where I removed the last link in the ArrayList becasue the program was printing the last line out twice.  This completely fixed the bug.
